# Part 1 of the technical test

## Language used - Python 3
## Question 1 - Factorial
### Notes
1. Classic recursion algorithm.
2. Time to solve - 15-20 mins

### Steps to run
1. Input the number on the command line you want to find the factorial for
2. Enter!

## Question 2 - Sorting
### Notes
1. The algorithm goes like this:
  a) loop the array, starting from index 1 (2nd element) to index array.length-1(2nd last element)
  b) if next number is greater than the current number, consider it a 'high'
  c) if next number is lower than the current number, consider it a 'low'
  d) The count of highs and lows decides whether to swap or reverse a sub-segment
  e) if count is 2, swap
  f) if count is 1, reverse the sub-segment
  g) Although, if both solutions are valid, prefer swapping
  h) If nothing works, print "no"
2. Time to solve - Close to 2 hours
3. It can be further optimized though.

### Steps to run
1. Input the number of elements in the array, followed by the elements seperated by space.
2. Enter!
